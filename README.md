# TFCert2023

In Fall 2023, UVicAI hosted a series of educational workshops to get our members introduced to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials), a popular machine learning framework and an entry point for the core ideas around this field. This series spanned multiple weeks and touched three broad topics: image classification, time series, and natural language. The selection of these topics was informed by the TensorFlow certification exam.

<h3>The Google Drive data folder</h3>

The Timeseries notebook references "airport data", which is available through the Google Drive link above.<br><br>
The "sunspots" dataset is a well-utilized timeseries dataset, but this version has the final year clipped. This is for a timeseries regression task where members didn't have access to the test set but had to determine how to validate their model on just the existing data.<br><br>
The "crowd trajectory" dataset is from Ohio State University ([Paper - Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00487)). It was not used in this series, but was discussed as an interesting application related to sequential data.
