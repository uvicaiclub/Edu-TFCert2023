# TFCert2023

In Fall 2023, UVicAI hosted a series of educational workshops to get our members introduced to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials), a popular machine learning framework and an entry point for the core ideas around this field. This series spanned multiple weeks and touched three broad topics: image classification, time series, and natural language. The selection of these topics was informed by the TensorFlow certification exam.

This repo hosts the notebooks and the corresponding slides can be found linked in [UVicAI's google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eT2m6cfUUrefFV77irGIewQt2yugYWKM?usp=sharing).
